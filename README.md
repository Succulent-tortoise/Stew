Stew v0.1 is a lightweight overnight processing system that generates a concise daily “Morning Brief” at 05:30. It reviews the previous 24 hours of journal-style inputs and extracts behavioural signals aligned to three core trajectory pillars: relationship (intentional connection with Jodie), mental/emotional discipline (focus, drift containment, self-regulation), and physical consistency (training and nutrition behaviours). The output is a short, slightly firm and directive brief that reinforces what is on track, highlights blind spots, and defines up to three specific, executable priority moves for the day.

The system is intentionally minimal: no long-term analytics, no complex modelling, and no optimisation loops. It acts as a behavioural stabiliser rather than a productivity engine or reflective therapy tool. By constraining output length, enforcing a hard cap on priorities, and flagging recurring drift patterns (such as unbounded system-building), Stew is designed to maintain clarity, prevent distraction creep, and keep daily effort aligned with long-term trajectory.
